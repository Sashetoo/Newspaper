                        The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of
                        medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional
                        German
                        herding dogs from 1899.
                        It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other
                        types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It
                        is
                        commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had
                        the
                        second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.

                        The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English
                        Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around 40–55 lb (18–25 kg).
                        They have large heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively
                        flat face with a protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence
                        of breeding for its distinctive appearance, including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia, heat
                        sensitivity, and skin infections. Due to concerns about their quality of life, breeding Bulldogs
                        is illegal in Norway and the Netherlands.
