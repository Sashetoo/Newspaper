                            The Siamese cat is one of the first
                            distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of
                            several varieties of cats native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the original Siamese
                            became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.[1]
                            The carefully refined, more extreme-featured, modern-style Siamese is characterised by blue
                            almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular
                            body; and various forms of point colouration. Other than colouration, the modern-style
                            Siamese bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional,
                            or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by
                            multiple registries as the Thai cat.

                        <p class="cat-text">
                            The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with
                            a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is
                            the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail.
                            The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including
                            tabby and colourpoint.
